 * Two separate connection pools, two separate database roles:
 *
 * - appPool/appDb  → role `haij_app`: every domain query. Fully subject to
 *   RLS; without an org context set it sees nothing (default deny).
 * - authPool/authDb → role `haij_auth`: used only by Better Auth, which by
 *   nature must look up users before an org context exists. The role is
 *   only granted access to the auth tables.
 *
 * Neither role can bypass RLS. Migrations run through a third connection
 * (MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL) used exclusively by drizzle-kit.
